### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
The design was fairly easy for me.
I learned that negative margin is useful when you want elements to overlap.


### Continued development
I failed to design the body background. I tried using position css property but still couldn't get it to work properly. I will work on the back ground again sometime.
